           Welcome to my first website. I am a Btech CSE student in Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar.
           I did my schooling from DAV Public School, Lawrence Road, Amritsar and got 96% in +2 CBSE 
           Board and cleared JEE mains with 90 %tile.
           Along with studies I have also went to many chess tournaments on District level and also take
           part in extra ciricular activities.</li>
          <li> It's just a starting to my new collage life and here I am very exciter to face nw challenge
           and have fun. I like to interact with people and try to understand their point of view over some common issues and new ideas. 
           I am learning from my seniors, my past mistakes and stepping ahead towards the world of coding
           with full enthusiasm and excitement.
