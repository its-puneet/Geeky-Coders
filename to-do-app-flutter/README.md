### Notes:

1) The app has  no hard-coded to-do values, and on launching for the first time, the items list will be blank.
2) This app uses the local file system to store it's to-do data. Data is stored in .txt file in permanent storage assigned to the app, as a      JSON    object.
3) The app has a dark mode as well, but the default mode is light mode.
