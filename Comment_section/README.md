Comments section is a widely used feature of websites especially blogs, e-commerce websites, news websites and somethings used as a part of contact section in personal portfolios. 

We are going to discuss the setup of a comment section form using the technologies – NodeJS, PHP and MySQL.

After we finish up the coding part, we move to installing and setting-up XAMPP to work on MYSQL.

The steps are:
•	Install XAMPP software on your local machine from the official website with default configurations.
•	Click on start Apache and MySQL actions. 
•	Click on Admin action of MySQL to land on phpMyAdmin portal connected to your localhost.
•	Create a new database using “new” option on the left side of the portal.
•	Create table with the required number of columns, here, I require only 4.
•	Insert column names, data types and other values to your table.
•	Now, we have completed setting up of database and its connection with our comment section. 

Note: Names of the database, table and table columns mentioned in the code should be the same as mentioned in the XAMPP software in order to avoid errors.
